	Backward reachability analysis verifies a robustness metric that guarantees system safety. However, it is premised on solving implicitly-constructed value functions on spatio-temporal grids to verify a robustness metric that guarantees system safety -- up to a specified time bound.  However, as state dimensions increase, time-space discretization methods become impractical owing to their exponential complexity. Approximation schemes in global value function space fail to preserve the robustness guarantees of basic backward reachability theory.
	We present an iterative decomposition scheme that incrementally truncates a high-dimensional value function to the minimum low-rank tensor necessary for computing  reachable sets, tubes and reach-avoid with guarantee to a local saddle-point extrema. 
	This paper presents an initial evaluation of our proposal on the backward reachable sets and a classical time-optimal bang-bang control time-to-reach the origin problem.
