	Backward reachability analysis verifies a robustness metric that guarantees system safety. However, it is premised on solving implicitly-constructed value functions on spatio-temporal grids to verify a robustness metric that guarantees system safety -- up to a specified time bound.  However, as state dimensions increase, time-space discretization methods become impractical owing to their exponential complexity. Approximation schemes in global value function space fail to preserve the robustness guarantees of basic backward reachability theory.
	We present \textit{safe to the last partial core}: an iterative proper generalized decomposition (PGD) scheme that incrementally truncates a high-dimensional value function to the minimum low-rank tensor necessary for computing  reachable sets and tubes with under-approximation guarantees. 
	Our scheme is essentially a PGD  \textit{a priori} model order reduction technique that allows us to tame the curse of dimensionality, and preserve reachability analyses guarantees up to a projection approximation error in numerical verification of complex systems with Cauchy-type Hamilton-Jacobi Isaacs terminal values.  This paper presents an initial evaluation of our proposal on the backward reachable sets and tubes of multiple pursuit-evasion system of deterministic dynamical systems.
