\section{Results and Discussion.}
\label{sec:results}
We now provide results and analysis of the proposed numerical algorithm on benchmark control problems.

\todo{If we decide to do bang-bang optimal control, then we need a new formulation in our power series expansion function. Whence why I think we should work with e.g. a Dubins car model for a PoC since its control law (the turn orientation) admits continuity in the state space.}
