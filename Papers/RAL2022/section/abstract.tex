	In a recently Algorithm Foundations of Robotics Workshop article submission, Ogunmolu proposed a verification scheme using Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs continuous-time model of complex nonlinear systems inspired by murmuratuions' emergent collective behavior. A many-bodied system of agents all moving in a plane with the same speed but with different headings were investigated and he gave a compelling analysis that large value functions can be decomposed into separated cells within the state space and then separately computed by leveraging local nearest neighbor rules utilized by European Starlings in murmurations. \todo{In this paper, we provide  
	\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
		\item a learning-based scheme for the dynamical system even in the presence of stochastic noise;
		%
		\item  an $H_\infty$ norm bound on the worst-possible disturbance that keeps the system maximally robust;
		%
		\item numerically robust scheme for assemblying the respective local value functions in a way that respects gaps, boundaries, and inter-flocking motion; and 
		%
		\item a demonstration of the verification scheme on a system of $n$ autonomous flocks.
	\end{inparaenum}
