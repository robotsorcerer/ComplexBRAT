%
In all our experiments, robust cohesion and anisotropy is reinforced by having one player be a pursuer against a flock of evaders as seen in \autoref{fig:robust_heading}. We initialize each flock's agents to distinct positions on the vectogram. All agents share the same linear speed, $v$ but varying orientations $\langle w^{(i)} (t) \rangle_r$ that are averaged across every nearest neighbor in a flock according to \eqref{eq:DubinsJadbabaie}. Nearest neighbors are updated according to Algorithm \ref{alg:neighbors}.

At issue is a family of games based on different starting points for local flocks that on the whole constitute a murmuration (see \autoref{fig:flocks_multi}). 
In starlings, agents move in local flocks of six to seven nearest neighbors~\cite{Ballerini1232} in order to preserve cohesion and heading consensus.  Therefore, we implicitly compute the payoff for each individual agent in every flock. In this light, a flock's payoff is a union (element-wise minimum f respective payoff points) of the payoff of every agent within it.  %and the f implicitly on a flock's state space as $\valuefunc: [-T, 0]\times \mc{X} \rightarrow \bb{R}$. 
%
Therefore, we define the target set and the tube as
%
\begin{align}
	&\targetset_0 = \left\{ \state \in \bar{\openset} | \valuefunc(\state, 0) \le 0, \valuefunc(\state, 0) = \valuefunc_1(\state_1, 0) \cup \cdots \cup \valuefunc_n(\state_n, 0)\right\} , \\
	&\mathcal{L}([\tau, 0],  \mathcal{L}_0) = \left\{\state\in \bar{\openset}  | \valuefunc(\state, \tau) \le 0, \valuefunc(\state, 0) = \valuefunc_1(\state_1, 0) \cup \cdots \cup \valuefunc_n(\state_n, 0)\right\} \nonumber
\end{align}
%
where $\tau \in  [-T, 0]$. A pictorial representation of the zero-level RCBRT of a differential  game with six-seven agents in the evading flock (\cf\autoref{fig:robust_heading}), constructed from a union of each agent's respective payoff,  is depicted in \autoref{fig:flocks_multi}. Each agent's payoff is implicitly defined by a signed distance representation on the state space~\cite{LevelSetsBook}. Abusing notation and dropping the $i$th superscript for an agent, we construct $\valuefunc(\cdot)$ as 
%
\begin{align}
	\valuefunc(\state, 0) = \sqrt{\state_1^2 + \state_2^2} - r_c
\end{align}
%
where $r_c$ is the capture radius, equivalent to the topological range for a flock as reported in~\cite{Ballerini1232}.

\subsection{Interagents Spatial Structure}

Every local flock has its own payoff, whose target set, together with those of nearest neighbors being interacted with are related by the surfaces. The zero level set of the union of these payoffs constitute the avoid set for a heading consensus. To ensure adequate spatial separation between every agent, we initialize a flock's $j$'s agents, $i=1,\ldots, n$ on the vectogram in the following way:
%
\begin{align}
	\state^{(i)_j} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
		r_c \cos (\frac{i\pi}{4}), & 	r_c \sin (\frac{i\pi}{4}), & h+i\,\delta h
	\end{array}\right]^T \, %\text{for } i=1, \cdots, n, 
\end{align}
%
where $h=0.1, \, \delta h = 0.05$ and $r_c$ is a collision avoidance radius.
