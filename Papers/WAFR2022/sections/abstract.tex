	Hitherto, the numerical verification of \textit{complex} and  \textit{nonlinear} systems  via the Isaacs equation (with an overapproximation guarantee of the backward reachable set or tube) has proven elusive owing to the exponential computational complexity associated with resolving  value functions on a mesh. In this work, we present a globally isotropic yet locally anisotropic reachable set/tube computational scheme, that enables the computation of the reach-avoid-tubes of multiple agents interacting over a large state space. This is achieved by resolving the extrema of payoffs on local substructures of the state space  whilst preserving desirable global payoff properties. Within the bounds here set, our scheme presents a simple yet effective strategy for designing the verification of \textit{nonlinear systems} for large backward reach-avoid sets or tubes. %This is the first paper to rationally solve a scalable safety verification problem with Hamilton-Jacobi-Jacobi Analysis.
