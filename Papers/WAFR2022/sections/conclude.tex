\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
%
We have proposed an Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs systems verification scheme, based on Hamilton-Jacobi's reachability theory for constructing backward reachable tubes and sets for a complex system under the assumption that special local structures inherent within the system can enable the chaining of separately computed value function's zero-level sets. 

One of the challenges we faced in our implementation is that the optimization scheme frequently halts at a local extrema of the solution landscape of the level set.
