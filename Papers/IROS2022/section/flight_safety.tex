\section{Flight and Safety}
\label{sec:flight_safety}

We consider a flight level and global heading orientation maintenance problem. We are inspired by air traffic control (ATC) problems whereupon airworthiness and aviation operational guidance requires Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) operations. RVSM airspace is any airspace or route where flight levels 290 and 410 inclusive must be vertically separated by $1000$ft. RVSM allows aircraft to \textit{safely} travel along better optimal profiles, save fuel usage, and increase airspace capacity~\cite{FAARVSM}. 

Altitude-keeping performance of airplanes is a key element in ensuring safe operations in ``RVSM-Compliant" airspace. The safety question involves strict altitude-keeping aircraft performance by tracking the altimetry system error (ASE)\footnote{The ASE is equivalent to the pressure altitude shown to the flightcrew and free stream pressure altitude.} to be within the error budget throughout a flight envelope. In our work, we consider the ASE tracking bounds a state constraint parameter. According to FAA separation standards~\cite{FAASep}, 

In addition, we want the orientation of every aircraft to be within a certain bound, $\omega_{min} < \omega \le \omega_{max}$.
