@article{Peherstorfer2016,
abstract = {This work presents a nonintrusive projection-based model reduction approach for full models based on time-dependent partial differential equations. Projection-based model reduction constructs the operators of a reduced model by projecting the equations of the full model onto a reduced space. Traditionally, this projection is intrusive, which means that the full-model operators are required either explicitly in an assembled form or implicitly through a routine that returns the action of the operators on a given vector; however, in many situations the full model is given as a black box that computes trajectories of the full-model states and outputs for given initial conditions and inputs, but does not provide the full-model operators. Our nonintrusive operator inference approach infers approximations of the reduced operators from the initial conditions, inputs, trajectories of the states, and outputs of the full model, without requiring the full-model operators. Our operator inference is applicable to full models that are linear in the state or have a low-order polynomial nonlinear term. The inferred operators are the solution of a least-squares problem and converge, with sufficient state trajectory data, in the Frobenius norm to the reduced operators that would be obtained via an intrusive projection of the full-model operators. Our numerical results demonstrate operator inference on a linear climate model and on a tubular reactor model with a polynomial nonlinear term of third order.},

abstract = {Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) equations are frequently encountered in applications, e.g., in control theory and differential games. H-J equations are closely related to hyperbolic conservation laws--in one space dimension the former is simply the integrated version of the latter. Similarity also exists for the multidimensional case, and this is helpful in the design of difference approximations. In this paper high-order essentially nonoscillatory (ENO) schemes for H-J equations are investigated, which yield uniform high-order accuracy in smooth regions and sharply resolve discontinuities in the derivatives. The ENO scheme construction procedure is adapted from that for hyperbolic conservation laws. The schemes are numerically tested on a variety of one-dimensional and two-dimensional problems, including a problem related to control optimization, and high-order accuracy in smooth regions, good resolution of discontinuities in the derivatives, and convergence to viscosity solutions are observed.},

abstract = {The proven efficacy of learning-based control schemes strongly motivates their application to robotic systems operating in the physical world. However, guaranteeing correct operation during the learning process is currently an unresolved issue, which is of vital importance in safety-critical systems. We propose a general safety framework based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability methods that can work in conjunction with an arbitrary learning algorithm. The method exploits approximate knowledge of the system dynamics to guarantee constraint satisfaction while minimally interfering with the learning process. We further introduce a Bayesian mechanism that refines the safety analysis as the system acquires new evidence, reducing initial conservativeness when appropriate while strengthening guarantees through real-Time validation. The result is a least-restrictive, safety-preserving control law that intervenes only when the computed safety guarantees require it, or confidence in the computed guarantees decays in light of new observations. We prove theoretical safety guarantees combining probabilistic and worst-case analysis and demonstrate the proposed framework experimentally on a quadrotor vehicle. Even though safety analysis is based on a simple point-mass model, the quadrotor successfully arrives at a suitable controller by policy-gradient reinforcement learning without ever crashing, and safely retracts away from a strong external disturbance introduced during flight.},

The algorithm is based on a proof that the reachable set is the zero sublevel set of the viscosity solution of a particular time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs partial differential equation. While alternative techniques for computing the reachable set have been proposed, the differential game formulation allows treatment of nonlinear systems with inputs and uncertain parameters. Because the time-dependent equation's solution is continuous and defined throughout the state space, methods from the level set literature can be used to generate more accurate approximations than are possible for formulations with potentially discontinuous solutions. A numerical implementation of our formulation is described and has been released on the web. Its correctness is verified through a two vehicle, three dimensional collision avoidance example for which ah analytic solution is available. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {Many existing tools in nonlinear control theory for establishing stability or safety of a dynamical system can be distilled to the construction of a certificate function that guarantees a desired property. However, algorithms for synthesizing certificate functions typically require a closed-form analytical expression of the underlying dynamics, which rules out their use on many modern robotic platforms. To circumvent this issue, we develop algorithms for learning certificate functions only from trajectory data. We establish bounds on the generalization error - the probability that a certificate will not certify a new, unseen trajectory - when learning from trajectories, and we convert such generalization error bounds into global stability guarantees. We demonstrate empirically that certificates for complex dynamics can be efficiently learned, and that the learned certificates can be used for downstream tasks such as adaptive control.},

abstract = {We introduce a new stochastic verification algorithm that formally quantifies the behavioral robustness of any time-continuous process formulated as a continuous-depth model. The algorithm solves a set of global optimization (Go) problems over a given time horizon to construct a tight enclosure (Tube) of the set of all process executions starting from a ball of initial states. We call our algorithm GoTube. Through its construction, GoTube ensures that the bounding tube is conservative up to a desired probability. GoTube is implemented in JAX and optimized to scale to complex continuous-depth models. Compared to advanced reachability analysis tools for time-continuous neural networks, GoTube provably does not accumulate over-approximation errors between time steps and avoids the infamous wrapping effect inherent in symbolic techniques. We show that GoTube substantially outperforms state-of-the-art verification tools in terms of the size of the initial ball, speed, time-horizon, task completion, and scalability, on a large set of experiments. GoTube is stable and sets the state-of-the-art for its ability to scale up to time horizons well beyond what has been possible before.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of exponentially stabilizing periodic orbits in a special class of hybrid models - systems with impulse effects - through control Lyapunov functions. The periodic orbit is assumed to lie in a C1 submanifold Z that is contained in the zero set of an output function and is invariant under both the continuous and discrete dynamics; the associated restriction dynamics are termed the hybrid zero dynamics. The orbit is furthermore assumed to be exponentially stable within the hybrid zero dynamics. Prior results on the stabilization of such periodic orbits with respect to the full-order dynamics of the system with impulse effects have relied on input-output linearization of the dynamics transverse to the zero dynamics manifold. The principal result of this paper demonstrates that a variant of control Lyapunov functions that enforce rapid exponential convergence to the zero dynamics surface, Z, can be used to achieve exponential stability of the periodic orbit in the full-order dynamics, thereby significantly extending the class of stabilizing controllers. The main result is illustrated on a hybrid model of a bipedal walking robot through simulations and is utilized to experimentally achieve bipedal locomotion via control Lyapunov functions. {\textcopyright} 1963-2012 IEEE.},

The current version of the algorithm is designed to find feasible paths or trajectories to goal regions in high dimensional spcaes. Future versions will be designed to find a solution that optimizes a real-valued criterion. Many simulated problems have been test, ranging from two-dimensional to nine-dimensional state-spaces, including mazes, path planning, non-linear dynamics, and planar snake robots in restricted spaces. In all cases, a good solution is found in less than ten trials and a few minutes.},

Our method combines fictitious self-play with deep reinforcement learning. When applied to Leduc poker, Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) approached a Nash equilibrium, whereas common reinforcement learning methods diverged. In Limit Texas Holdem, a poker game of real-world scale, NFSP learnt a strategy that approached the performance of state-of-the-art, superhuman algorithms based on significant domain expertise.},

The method employs Operator Inference, a scientific machine learning framework combining data-driven learning and physics-based modeling. The parametric structure of the governing equations is embedded directly into the reduced-order model, and parameterized reduced-order operators are learned via a data-driven linear regression problem. The result is a reduced-order model that can be solved rapidly to map parameter values to approximate PDE solutions. Such parameterized reduced-order models may be used as physics-based surrogates for uncertainty quantification and inverse problems that require many forward solves of parametric PDEs. Numerical issues such as well-posedness and the need for appropriate regularization in the learning problem are considered, and an algorithm for hyperparameter selection is presented. The method is illustrated for a parametric heat equation and demonstrated for the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model.},

However, very little is known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories mostly rely on aprioristic assumptions. By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock{\textquoteright}s cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one.},

Ergodic exploration enables robotic systems to indirectly sample from informative spatial distributions globally, avoiding local optima, and without the need to evaluate the derivatives of the distribution against the robot dynamics. Using a hybrid systems theory, we derive a controller that allows a robot to exploit equilibrium policies (i.e., policies that solve a task) while allowing the robot to explore and generate informative data using an ergodic measure that can extend to high-dimensional states. We show that our method is able to maintain Lyapunov attractiveness with respect to the equilibrium task while actively generating data for learning tasks such, as Bayesian optimization, model learning, and off-policy reinforcement learning. In each example, we show that our proposed method is capable of generating an informative distribution of data while synthesizing smooth control signals. We illustrate these examples using simulated systems and provide simplification of our method for real-time online learning in robotic systems.},
