### Introduction

Large Backward Reach Avoid Tubes

### Examples

+ [Basic Double Integrator](/Examples/dint_basic.py): Time to reach the origin for the double integrator with switching curve dynamics.

+ [Robustly Controlled Backward Reachable Tube -- Two Dubins Vehicles in Relative Coordinates](/Examples/dubins_rel.py): Evaluate the backward reachable tube for two Dubins vehicles in relative coordinates. The pursuer is at the origin.
